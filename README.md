# AlignMates
AlignMates is an interactive application designed to visualize the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, a fundamental algorithm used in bioinformatics for aligning genomic/proteomic sequences. It allows users to input two sequences and set parameters for match, mismatch, and gap penalties to compute the optimal global alignment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- cmu_graphics
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure `dna.png` and `help.png` are in the project directory.
3. Run `AlignMates.py` in your Python environment.

## Usage
- **Tab**: Switches between input fields.
- **Enter**: Executes the sequence alignment algorithm.
- **Escape/Space/Right Arrow**: Switches between screens/views.

## Additional Notes
Ensure all input sequences are valid DNA/RNA/protein sequences. The application is case-insensitive for sequence inputs. Match, mismatch, and gap scores should be integers.
